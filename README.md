# image-processing-basics
Introductory image processing project built during Deep Learning course at Tehran Data
## 🛠 Libraries Used

- `matplotlib.pyplot` for loading and displaying images
- `numpy` for handling image data as arrays

## 📌 What You’ll Learn

- Reading an image using `plt.imread()`
- Displaying the image using `plt.imshow()`
